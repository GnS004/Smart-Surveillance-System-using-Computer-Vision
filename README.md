# Smart Surveillance System using Computer Vision

A deep learning–based **Smart Surveillance System** that performs **real-time Fire & Smoke Detection** and **Garbage Detection** using computer vision techniques.  
The system is designed for **smart cities, campuses, and public safety monitoring** applications. This projects uses completely customised Datasets.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project implements a **modular computer vision surveillance system** that analyzes images and video streams to detect:
- 🔥 Fire & Smoke hazards
- 🗑️ Garbage and waste in public areas

The system leverages **YOLO-based object detection models** to provide fast and accurate real-time predictions from multiple input sources such as webcams, video files, and CCTV/RTSP streams.
